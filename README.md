Each directory is a program I created while learning the frameworks and tools required.\
I am certain there are best practices that I have completely omitted as I am learning as I go\
and best practices are not usually taught in demos. Just how to do the thing you came to learn.

If you feel the urge to tell me what I've done wrong please feel free so long as you provide a better way.\
Please also explain why you believe your way is better.

Also, Thank you in advance for the information.
